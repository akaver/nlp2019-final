I have a Laravel / Vue JS application that integrates a google map component as well as a Vuetify data-table component. The Vue instance also has a computed property that calculates the points for the Google Map, which is based upon another computed property calculated by the Vuetify data-table. This doesn't work. It throws a type error: This is because the filteredItems computed property within the Vuetify data-table component has not been calculated yet at the time the GoogleMap component evaluates it. If i comment out the GoogleMap component that uses the "points" computed property, and evaluate the points property using Vue JS Devtools after page render, the points property data is calculated correctly. This is because the computed property is not evaluated for the first time until you access it with Devtools, so the page has already been rendered. So the "points" computed property evaluates fine after page render, but at the time the GoogleMap conponents tries to first calculate it.
